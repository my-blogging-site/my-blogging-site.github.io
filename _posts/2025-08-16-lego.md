# My first lego!

I've always wanted to own lego. It's been a small dream that went unfulfilled for many years. My parents got me the knock off ones which were never the complete set or were random pieces. We didn't have a lot of money growing up. Now I'm at an age where I have enough spending money that I can purchase a set. 


A problem I realised was once i made the piece, it'll take too much real estate. I need a lego piece that I can leave in my room and doesn't take too much space. That's why i went for bonsai tree.

Look at that beauty:

What a great experience! It reminds me of assembling ikea furniture, with the step by step guidance. I did assemble some pieces without looking at the steps though. I am definitely going to do more over time. The enjoyment comes from putting together random pieces into something 3D that looks wonderful. Would definitely recommend the experience for others.
