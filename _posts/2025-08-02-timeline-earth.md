# Timeline of Earth

Back in school, I was often quite lost when we were taught parts of
history. In the UK, all I was taught about were the Tudors and World War
2 --- that's it. I understand that there wasn't much time to cover the
entire history of Earth and that history is about analysis, not just
facts. However, it would have been really helpful to have a timeline
showing how things unfolded from start to finish. This is my attempt at
filling that gap.

## The Big Bang to Earth

What better place to start than the very beginning? About 13.8 billion
years ago, all matter was concentrated in a single, very dense point.
Then an explosion caused all matter to expand rapidly from this point
(and it's still expanding!). This event is called **The Big Bang**.

As matter moved through the universe, collisions caused matter to
coalesce and form stars. Young stars use hydrogen and helium and release
energy through nuclear fusion, held together by their own gravity. Our
Sun is a star that formed about 9 billion years ago and is situated in a
galaxy called the Milky Way. To give a sense of scale, the Milky Way is
just one of approximately 400 billion galaxies in the observable
universe.

## Formation of the Earth

-   **4.6 billion years ago:** Dust surrounding the Sun formed the
    Earth.
-   **4.5 billion years ago:** A Mars-sized body collided with Earth,
    resulting in debris that eventually coalesced to form the Moon.
-   **4.0 billion years ago:** Earth was a molten mass, constantly
    bombarded by space matter. It cooled and formed a thin crust. Water
    vapor condensed, forming Earth's oceans.
-   **3.8 billion years ago:** First life appeared on Earth.
    Microorganisms likely formed in hydrothermal vents or hot springs.
-   **252 million years ago:** A mass extinction event occurred --- the
    most severe loss of life in Earth\'s history.
-   **230 million years ago:** Dinosaurs and mammals emerged.
-   **200 million years ago:** The supercontinent Pangea began breaking
    up.
-   **66 million years ago:** Another mass extinction, likely caused by
    a large asteroid impact, led to the continents forming into their
    current shapes.
-   **7 million years ago:** The first hominins emerged, diverging from
    apes. Key traits: bipedalism and smaller canine teeth.
-   **About 2 million years ago:** The Ice Ages began.
-   **About 300,000 years ago:** The first Homo sapiens appeared in
    Africa --- that's us!
-   **100,000 years ago:** Homo sapiens began migrating out of Africa.
    Humans started using fire, forming shelters, and hunting with
    weapons.
-   **40,000 years ago:** Humans started making advanced tools.
-   **Approximately 10,000 years ago:** Human civilization began and the
    Ice Ages ended.

## Human Civilization

As humans transitioned from hunter-gatherer societies to settled
agricultural communities around 10,000 years ago, ancient civilizations
formed, including:

-   Mesopotamia
-   Indus Valley
-   Ancient Egypt
-   Ancient China
-   Ancient Greece
-   Ancient Rome
-   Ancient Peru

### Main Periods of Human Civilization

-   **Early Bronze Age:** 3300 - 2100 BCE
-   **Bronze Age:** 3300 - 1200 BCE
-   **Iron Age:** 1200 - 600 BCE
-   **Classical Antiquity:** 800 BCE - 476 CE
-   **Middle Ages:** 476 - 1453 CE
-   **Modern Period:** 1453 CE - Present

## Modern Period

We now focus on the modern period, which includes the Scientific
Revolution and the Industrial Revolution. The transition from an
agrarian to an industrial society was driven by technological
innovations such as the steam engine and the harnessing of fossil fuels
like coal, oil, and gas.

European imperialism made Europe the dominant global power from 1800 to
1945. Afterward, globalization and the information age (1945 to present)
increased interconnectedness through technology and trade.

### Key Events in the Modern Era

-   1880: Thomas Edison invents the incandescent light bulb.
-   1903: The Wright brothers achieve the first powered flight.
-   1913: Niels Bohr proposes a model of the atom with discrete energy
    levels, laying the groundwork for quantum mechanics.
-   1945: Atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
-   1947: Invention of the transistor by Shockley, Bardeen, and
    Brattain.
-   1969: Apollo 11 lands on the Moon.
-   1990: Tim Berners-Lee invents the World Wide Web.
-   2022: ChatGPT released by OpenAI.

## Looking to the Future

Looking ahead, things that could wipe out humanity can be categorised
into two things: cosmic and human caused threats.

1\. Cosmic - asteroid(like 60 mil years ago) and expansion of earth in
about 5 billion years, the Sun will run out of hydrogen and start using
helium for nuclear fusion. It will expand into a red giant, engulfing
Mercury and Venus. Earth may survive but will become uninhabitable due
to extreme heat. Mars may survive the Sun's expansion, making it a
candidate for future habitation.

2\. Human caused - climate change, nuclear war, engineered pandemics,
Cyberattacks
