I thought i would attempt to model my house in SAP to get a deeper understanding the SAP calculations. An image of my EPC can be seen below where the higher the score indicates a better SAP rating.

**TLDR:** I managed to get it to within 2 SAP points. I got 64 wheras the assessor got 66 SAP points. Although I correctly use suspended timber floors instead of solid with no insulation.

![epc](/assets/epc.png)

To summarise what my EPC told me:
```
- 4 bedrooms mid terraced house
- Age band: 1930-1949
- Total floor area: 80m2
- Main heating system: Boiler and radiators, mains gas
- Control: Programmer, room thermostat and TRVs
- Floor: Solid, no insulation (assumed)
- Windows: double glazing
- Walls: Solid brick, as built, no insulation (assumed)
- Roof: Pitched roof, no insulation
- Lighting: Low energy lighting in all fixed outlets
- Floor height: 2.50m
- Natural ventilation

```
I've implemented using the [SAP 2012 specification](https://bregroup.com/documents/d/bre-group/sap-2012_9-92), I've called it PySAP since it's written in Python and based on SAP. It's made in a Jupyternotebook so I can write code and see the output in the notebook - SAP is pretty simple compared to other models so this is OK. I converted the notebook to markdown using the command:
```
jupyter nbconvert pysap.ipynb --to markdown
```

The EPC that was carried out on my house was using Reduced SAP (RdSAP). RdSAP is used when detailed specifications aren't available. In order to model this I first started by implementing full SAP then RdSAP since RdSAP is like a wrapper on top of full SAP. I didn't implement RdSAP fully either. I chose to look up values from the SAP 2012 in the RdSAP section where needed and implement calculations. 

I will release the code in the future - for now it's very rough code at the moment and only works in certain cases. The plan is edit until i can model my house fully. It is NOT intendedd to be a full working SAP implementation. I need to do more adjustments before it looks like my house. 

Anyway, here is the code and output:

```python
import math
```


```python
# Inputs not used but needed for RdSAP for look up in Tables

#The room count is equal to the number of habitable rooms

# the lowest storey, to obtain the storey height.
first_floor_storey_height = ground_floor_storey_height + 0.25

# Calculations
