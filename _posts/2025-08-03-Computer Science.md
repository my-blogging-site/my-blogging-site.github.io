# My dummies guide to  computer science

As as self-taught programmer, I often feel like I lack a sense of fundamental
knowledge in programming. I understand some bits and can put together code, but
it's often not the complete picture. This post is intended as a reference for
me if i forget the basics, I can come back here to re-read or add to my core
knowledge.

## What is computer science?
Is the study of using computers to solve problems. It's made up of:
1. Computing systems
2. Algorithms and programming
3. Data and analysis
4. Networks and the internet

## Computers
A computer stores, shares and analyses huge amounts of information and is
capable of carrying out complex calculations.

Hardware
There are input devices (mouse, keyboard), storage devices (USB, RAM),
processing (CPU, GPU) and Output (display, speakers). 

The crucial part of computers is transistors. Transistors are essentially tiny
switches that can either be on or off (1 or 0). We need to pass enough voltage
and current through the control pin it allows flow of electricity.

Software
The BIOS connects the hardware to the Operating system. The operating system
talks to the drivers and system applications. The bootloader is the first
program that starts the computer. It loads the OS into
the memory and starts the computer by connecting BIOS to OS and allows the OS to
take over. Other applications compatabile with the OS can then run on the
computer.
 
## Data analysis
Once computers became in wide use, more and more data was being collected from
it's users. The information age means all the data we give our computers can be
used by others (social media). 

We refer to data as unorganised. Information is organised data and allows us to
gleam insights.

Computers can only understand binary data (0,1). For example, when you write
python code, the computer converts the code into binary data which is then
passed to the CPU to carry out the instructions. Python complies to bytecode
(.pyc files). The PVM runs the byte code by converting to binary code. The CPU
then runs the binary data by running fetch-decode-execute cycle.
 
The computer can only understand binary data essentially. Anything you run
text, images and numbers have to be convertered to binary code for the computer
to run.

TODO: talk about RGB and Hexadecimal


## Programming
Algorithmns are like recipes. They give you instructions on what to do. When you
write any program, you are writing algoritmns first then converting them into
code for the computer to run.

Programming languages
Scripting languages
- the code sits in the way it's written and the computer it's run on takes it
  and interprets it. 

Compiled language
The code is compiled first into an exe file which is then used on the
destination computer. The compiler does a big find and replace into smaller bits
that the computer can understand. The compiler is done for speicific operating
systems. That means exe can run on some OS but not others. Interpreted languages
do not sufer from this since they have not been encoded yet. 

Query languge
- used to interact with databases e.g. SQL

Markup language
- HTML
- XML


Programming fundamentals
- for loops, while loops
- conditional statements
- functions


Programming tips
- write a spec
- README file - documenting
- testing


## Web development
A network is a group of connected computers either via Ethernet or Wifi. Wireless is using radiowaves to send info.

The internet is all the computers in the world connected via networks.
When you are on your computer and you want to connect to the internet
wirelessly. Your Wifi adapter sends a radio signal to your router. The router is
your home's hub controlling flow of signals to the internet. Modern routers
contain modems which are the components that talk to the internet.
The modem talks to Internet Service Provider (ISP) which is the main gateway to
the internet. 
ISP allow different routes to connect to the internet e.g. DSL, fiber optic and
cable broadband.

When you ask a website to be loaded. The information of that website is usually
in a server somewhere. You the person with the device requesting the info are
the client. 

TODO:
The info is sent as packets via the TCP protocol.
HTML - language to create sturcutre of a website
HTTP - transfer info over internet. E.g. Chrome uses HTTP to send info to
computers that store websites.
