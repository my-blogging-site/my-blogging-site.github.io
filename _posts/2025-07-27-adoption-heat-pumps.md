## Adoption of heat pumps in the UK

**Why do we want to install heat pumps in the UK?**<br>
Approximately 75% of the UK housing stock is heated by mains gas boilers. The gas comes from natural gas produced from the North Sea and imported gas. The UK is looking to reduce it's reliance on fossil fuels as part of it's 2050 net zero emission target, to do this UK is increasing it's the renewable energy generation. As the grid becomes more decarbonised the clean electricity that is produced will need to be used in homes to reduce emissions and this is only possible if the heating systems in the homes are powered off electricity not gas. This is where the electrically driven heat pumps come in. Heat pumps work by extracting energy from sources like air, ground and water and transfer it to homes for space or water heating. By transferring the energy from natural sources, it allows the heat pump to deliver more energy than it uses - this is also what allows heat pumps to be typically three times more efficient than gas boilers.

**What is the current status of heat pump installs?**<br>
The UK has approximately 250,000 certified heat pumps installed in the UK. In 2024, there was approximately 60,000 heat pump installs carried out. The UK government has an aim to install 600,000 heat pumps annually in 2028 as part of the Energy Security Bill. France for comparison installed 620,000 heat pumps in 2022.

**What are the main challengers to achieving 600,000 annual installs?**<br>
There are three main challenges in installing heat pumps in the UK:
- High upfront cost to replace gas boilers
- Low running cost savings compared to gas boilers
- Skilled work force - not enough qualified heat pump installers

If we look at each of these:

**High upfront costs**<br>
The total cost of installing a heatpump can range from £10,000 to £18000 depending on house type, type of heat pump and specific install requirements. To incentivise people to install heat pumps, the government is offering £7,500 towards installing heat pumps in England and Wales as part of the Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS).

**Low running costs savings**<br>
If we take a house that has 10,000 kWh demand. A condensing gas boiler is typically 90% efficiency and the cost for gas in the UK April 2025 is approx 7p/kWh. This means the cost of meeting the demand with the gas boiler is: 10,000 kWh/0.9 * 7p/kWh = £777

A heat pump typically has a COP of 3 and the cost of electricity in the UK April 2025 is approx 27p/kWh. The cost of meeting this house's demand with the heat pump is: 10,000kWh/3 * 27p/kWh = £900

This shows currently it's more expensive to run heat pumps. However, the cost of electricity will fall as the grid is powered off more renewables. The cost of gas may also go up as natural sources become depleted. It is also worth noting, there are  heat pumps that have a COP of more than 3, this may make them cheaper than the example above.

**Skilled workforce**<br>
In 2023, there were 7,800 qualified heat pump engineers, the heat pump association (HPA) estimates 27,000 will be needed in 2028.  The UK government is offering £500 grants through the heat training grant to train heating engineers to become qualified heat pump installers.
