If we see the UK as an energy balance where the energy generated has to be used by demand we can begin to understand the flow of energy in the UK.

Let's start with the demand that the UK has, this can be largely broken into 4 major sectors: Domestic sector, Transport sector, Industrial sector and Services sector.

**Domestic sector**
The domestic sector is the mainly the energy used for space and water heating of homes. A smaller proportion is lighting, appliances and cooking.<br>
Energy source: mains gas for heating, electricity for lighting and appliances

**Transport sector**
The main use in transport is oil (petroleum product) for road transport then air transport and lastly maritime transport. The growing demand is electricity for electric vehicles. <br>
Energy source: mainly oil

**Industrial sector**
The industrial sector is made up of manufacturing processes and chemical and food processing. The sector also uses energy for raw material extraction and processing for use.<br>
Energy source: gas, electricity

**Services sector**
The services sector uses energy in  HVAC, lighting, ICT (information and communication technology), electronics and refrigeration. <br>
Energy source: gas, electricity

From the different sectors we can see the main energy sources are Electricity, gas and oil. The electricity is split approximately equally between domestic, industrial and service sector.  Gas is the dominant source for domestic heating in the UK.

To meet this demand the UK has a variety of energy sources for electricity generation:<br>
**Wind**
There are two types of wind generation: onshore and offshore which is approx split evenly.

**Solar**
There is domestic and commercial solar panels. On the domestic side there are solar PV to generate electricity and solar thermal to directly heat water.

**Hydroelectric**
Hydroelectric is a small component of the UK energy mix.

**Gas**
The last coal fired power station closed in 2024. Now gas is the main fossil fuel that powers the UK. UK produces about half of it's gas from the North Sea and imports the other half.

**Nuclear**
Most of existing reactors are set to retire by 2030, but there are plans to expand the nuclear reactors.

**Biomass**
Biomass has struggled to get enough supply and has sourced wood from abroad which doesn't make it as sustainable.
